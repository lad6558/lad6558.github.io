#### Part One

"Rumor has it, this old man is tough to deal with."

<br>

"Yes, he does as he pleases... There’s no recording during classes, he doesn’t distribute slides, and he doesn’t have regular office hours. I heard the department lets him teach this course just because he’s Sussman."

<br>

Fortunately, the old man doesn’t understand Chinese. He calmly pulled a stack of documents from his briefcase and laid them on the desk, clipped the microphone to his "Nerd Pride" shirt, prominently displaying several pens in his shirt pocket. This was my first time meeting the old man.

My sketch of Sussman. Whenever I don’t understand something in class, I end up doodling and scribbling in my notes.

<br>

Gerald Jay Sussman, 76, a professor in the MIT Department of Computer Science, inventor of the Scheme programming language, author of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)" and "Software Development for Flexibility (SDF)," both classics in the CS curriculum. If Python’s position in programming languages is akin to English, then Scheme’s would be like Latin: deeply influential and clearly structured, yet archaic and seldom used.

<br>

Of course, I only learned these things later. My reason for choosing the Large Symbolic Systems (6.905/6.945) programming class was simply because I heard from an upperclassman that he liked to chat over tea with students. However, when I mentioned my intention to take his class, all I heard were uniformly negative reviews. Some said he was inflexible, others complained he often went off-topic during electric circuit recitations, and some pondered before concluding, "Well… he is strongly-opinionated for sure." I figured the only way to know if the course was right for me was to enroll.

<br>

"Today we’re talking about the Scheme programming language. Any programming language, whether it’s Python, Java, or Lisp, is composed of only three parts: primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction…"

<br>

He flipped through the slides one by one; the presentation contained only code, no English text. He explained from the first line to the last, then flipped to the next page, repeat. As he spoke, he reminisced about the old days, like "back when we programmers debugged over the phone," "when I was writing Fortran on the XX-XX machine at IBM," and "the night in the '70s when my buddy Guy Steele and I wrote the first Scheme interpreter..." When class ended, he declared, "Alright, that is the entirety of the Scheme language. Since I have shared everything this time, I won’t teach it again. Class dismissed."

#### Part Two

Afterward, every class felt like it was on fast-forward, with the old man explaining the code from the first line to the last. This was his language, one he had been writing for nearly 50 years; he could read Scheme faster than I could read Chinese. Once he had finished all the slides, he would look at his watch, chuckle, and say, "Haha, I finished five minutes early again today," leaving a group of students completely baffled. After a few classes, the once bustling lecture hall dwindled to just a dozen students. He proudly announced, "This is the ideal class size I’ve always wanted." With each class, I understood less and less, and I had to figure out a way to cope.
<br>

I began interrupting him whenever I didn’t understand something. "Question!" "Yes, sir!" "You argue that this is a better design. But I think…" I’m usually not interested in technical details. What interests me is why a design is good, what innovative aspects a program displays. He patiently answered, often spending up to ten minutes on a dialogue between him and me. He always managed to include personal opinions in his answers, such as "I think this clearly shows the stupidity of Python," "These modern programming languages are just trivial toys invented by Scheme thirty years ago." His responses like this became frequent, and I couldn’t help but ask, "If these programming principles you advocate are so good, why haven’t they been widely adopted in the industry?" He would then pose solemnly like Kong Yiji, arguing, "Good design has no correlation with wide adoption!" and then he would start telling stories about "what the IBM vice president personally told him," such as "the x86 system was adopted purely because it was too terrible for anyone else to bother with," and so on, filling the classroom with a lively atmosphere.

<br>

My routine of asking questions became established, and one day after class, he proudly announced, "We have a questioner in this class!" From then on, every time he spoke, he would pause to glance at me, waiting for my query before continuing. Sometimes after class, he would seriously say, "Thank you for asking so many questions—you allow me to philosophize, and slow me down just the right amount so that others can understand." When I had to leave in the middle of a session, he would comment, "Our questioner has disappeared! Someone else has to ask all those questions!" Having received his personal approval, I became even more bold, relentlessly questioning his design principles and innovations before letting him continue. He indeed needed someone to ask questions—I had indeed heard from others that without my inquiries, the lectures were incomprehensible.
<br>

#### Part Three

Assignments in this course were also unusual. We would email our code to the old man, and he personally graded it. When I received his response to my first assignment, I felt a mix of unease and gratitude. His reply went like this: "I’ve read your code from start to finish. In the comments of this function, you mentioned that you couldn’t think of a good identity function. Actually, your function could be written like this." Then, he typed a revised version of the code in plain text in the email, detailing the testing process and results. "Also, these two functions of yours are very interesting; I’ve never seen them before. As for the extra question, even though it meets the requirements, I thought you might choose something more challenging.—GJS" He reviewed the code more thoroughly than any TA I had during introductory programming classes.
<br>

At the start of the semester, as Scheme was a niche programming language, it was not easy to install. The old man specifically set aside time, saying students who couldn’t install it could come to him for personal assistance. At the beginning of the term, when there were still many students in the class, about a dozen couldn’t get it installed, so he went from one student to another, installing it on each computer. He typed using only two slightly trembling index fingers; even using shortcuts was a challenge for his hand-eye coordination. Whenever he encountered a problem, he would murmur "Hmmm" and fall into thought. During these moments, I and the students nearby would exchange looks: indeed, programmers should be young. Each time he identified a problem, he would get very excited, exclaiming "Ha! That is where it is!" and danced around, pointing out the issue to us. He continued this from 7 PM until 11 PM, until I, the last student, waved goodbye and left the classroom. Then he finally relaxed, sat down, and took a drink.
<br>

During a private conversation, he proudly stated that he had seen every bug imaginable and could program much faster than us novices. I mentioned that he wasn’t typing as quickly as he used to. He waved his hand dismissively, "All people will break, and when they do, they will be very broken. I am not broken yet."
<br>

#### Part Four

The old man loved tea, especially Chinese tea. Whenever students visited his office, he would first pour a cup of Longjing for everyone before answering questions. One time, I tried to pour him some tea,
<br>

"In our Chinese culture, it’s the youngest person at the table who pours tea for the others."
<br>

"In our Jewish culture, we don’t have such nonsense. I'll do it."
<br>

He filled my cup and then his, grinning proudly, "I'm not religious. But do you know why devout Jews wear yarmulkes?"
<br>

"Why?"
<br>

"Because no one can make them take it off—in other words, no one is above us. Kings can send us to war, to die, but they can’t make us remove our hats."
<br>

He always scoffed at power: "Once, they wanted me to be department head. When that guy walked into this office, I only said one thing to him: you have 5 minutes to leave the office before I call the police." His love was reserved for his knowledge alone.
<br>

Once, I saw him lending a topology book to a student. When I asked about it, he inquired:
<br>

"Are you good at math?"
<br>

I answered honestly, "Not really. I’ve only studied linear algebra and probability."
<br>

"Don’t you study anything else? That’s a pity."
<br>

"What’s the use of learning it?" I was surprised by how hideous my question sounded. But I realized I was constantly doubting the usefulness of learning all these miscellaneous things every day. This old man didn’t seem to harbor such self-doubt, so I sought his advice on how to achieve that.
<br>

"It's useless for programming. But it can enhance your thinking."
<br>

"What’s the use of enhancing thinking?" I threw another question at him, one I couldn’t answer myself. I always felt there should be some usefulness to thinking about so many things, but I couldn't articulate what it was.
<br>

"Enhancing thinking helps you see connections between different things." He walked to the whiteboard and drew a triangle. "This is the Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphisms. It's a mathematical theorem, but it also symbolizes the essence of science. This arrow is like building a model, that arrow is applying the model, and this arrow means that, in our consideration, we can disregard irrelevant factors. See, we can learn profound truths from mathematical theorems."
<br>

I was moved by the beauty and simplicity of the theory for two seconds. "Then why not learn the truths directly?"
<br>

"You could. But pondering these connections is very enjoyable."
<br>

"What else have you gained besides intellectual satisfaction?"
<br>

"What if," he smiled mysteriously, "that is all I want?"
<br>

"What’s the difference between that and playing games or doing drugs?" This was a question someone had asked me long ago, questioning why playing games or chess doesn't receive the same recognition as math. I couldn’t answer. I felt they were all manipulating symbols defined by human rules for intellectual satisfaction. The logic seemed odd, but if forced to compare, playing games seemed more useful, providing multi-sensory stimulation beneficial for various brain areas.
<br>

He was clearly not prepared for such a question, so he shifted to discussing the difference between pleasures bestowed by nature and those created artificially, which I found unconvincing. Neither of us had a good answer, but we pursue knowledge anyway.
<br>

#### Part Five

Unfortunately, I wasn’t very diligent in this course, sometimes quite willful. I still felt he was too conservative, failing to keep up with the evolving thoughts in the computing world, always muttering about technologies from decades ago. Despite being beautiful and intellectually satisfying, his lifetime effort in designing intelligent systems couldn’t compare to modern artificial intelligence built on computational power and data. Human intelligence is limited; computational power is limitless. There’s a famous joke in the AI field: for every linguist who leaves an NLP team, the accuracy improves by two points. The old man, advocating human wisdom and symbolic logic, was like a mayfly shaking a tree in the face of connectionist neural networks centered on money, computational power, and user data. It’s possible that large language models could replace most programmers within a decade, including the old man.
<br>

Out of distaste, I didn’t work hard outside of class. But this was an advanced programming course, and soon, I couldn’t keep up with the assignments based on my stream-of-consciousness understanding from the lectures. I asked him for an extension, and he said, "Sure, I don’t care about grades, nor correctness - what matters is that you put your thought into your problem set. You should show that you have learned something from me."
<br>

I thought, isn’t that easy? I symbolically scribbled a bit, and that was it. So, I reread the chapter in his book related to the assignment back and forth three times, the more I read, the more I felt these programming patterns reflected his outdated thoughts. If I learned his methods, I’d end up like him, a decrepit old man stuck in the programs he wrote years ago, abandoned by the tides of time.
<br>

After much thought, I changed my original plan and wrote overnight, submitting only commented code. The comments formed an essay titled "The Paradox of Elegance: Mud Huts and Diamond Palace."
<br>

The code (original GitHub Repo see "Read Original Text") began with a quote from the old man's book. "A diamond-like system is beautiful, but it's hard to add anything to a diamond. If a system is made of mud, it might not look nice, but it's easy to add more mud." The gist of the text was that the old man's ideas had become outdated in this fast-paced era. He didn't advocate for complex, rigid systems like diamonds, preferring simple, flexible systems like mud huts, but he had long been trapped within the high walls of his own diamond palace, living comfortably but unwilling to venture beyond its walls. I had GPT-4 translate the entire text, just for the sake of irony:
<br>

I think my Chinese is still not bad compared to GPT-4.

<br>
The reason I thought about all this was because I saw a part of myself in him—the part that studies purely for the interest in knowledge. This wasn’t a contradiction between him and me, but my own internal conflict. It seemed I was trying to prove that abandoning romantic illusions about academia in favor of pragmatism was the mature choice.

<br>
A few days later, I received his reply.
