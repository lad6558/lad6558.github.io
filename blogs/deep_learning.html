The increasing application of LLMs has led to a central problem: how to properly evaluate the quality of model-generated responses?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ves7sh">While alignment with human judgments remains the gold standard, LLMs could potentially serve as their own judges, solving the very challenges they present. <strong>LLM-as-a-Judge</strong> is the use of LLMs to evaluate the quality, relevance, or correctness of responses generated by other LLMs, serving as automated evaluators in various tasks. As a substitute of human judgements, LLM-as-a-Judge has unique advantages [1]:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-nznh2k"><li><strong>Scalability and Speed</strong>: LLMs can evaluate responses rapidly and manage large-scale tasks with ease, making them ideal for handling extensive datasets or frequent evaluations.</li> <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness</strong>: Using LLMs for evaluation reduces the expenses of hiring, training, and managing human evaluators, particularly for large or ongoing projects.</li> <li><strong>Customizability</strong>: LLMs can be fine-tuned or adjusted to focus on specific evaluation criteria, allowing them to adapt to a wide range of tasks and domains effectively.</li></ol> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1xnzr9n">The Setups for Model Judges</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-tmfwtq">To conduct evaluations using LLM-as-a-Judge, all it takes is crafting a well-designed prompt! Here are three commonly used setups for instructing the models to act as evaluators [2]:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-fmelbr"><li><strong>Pairwise Comparison</strong>: Judges compare two model-generated responses to a question and select the better one, ideal for identifying subtle differences between models.</li> <li><strong>Pointwise Scoring</strong>: Judges rate a single response on a predefined scale (e.g., 1 to 5), focusing on its quality independently of others.</li> <li><strong>Reference-Guided Scoring</strong>: Judges use a reference answer as a benchmark to evaluate responses, ensuring consistent and standard-aligned scoring.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1uqeu20">Each of these setups caters to specific evaluation needs and can also be enhanced through contextual prompt engineering—there’s no universal standard for guiding model judges!</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1m7q4j2">The Biases in Judges &amp; Methods for Improvement</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-132rf64">LLM-as-a-Judge is effective at predicting human preferences but comes with limitations and biases that affect evaluation quality. Common issues include <strong>Verbosity Bias</strong>–tending to score longer responses higher, even when they lack substance. <strong>Position Bias</strong>–favoring responses based on their order in the prompt, such as preferring the first in pairwise comparisons. A more comprehensive list of biases is given below [3]:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-zdz974"><img src="/blogs/deep_learning/1.png" alt="List of biases in LLM-as-a-Judge" title="List of biases in LLM-as-a-Judge">Recent efforts to enhance LLM-as-a-Judge have focused on developing robust evaluation platforms to mitigate model biases and limitations. Here are some sample strategies [1]:</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-syuq1g"><li><strong>Position switching trick:</strong> Randomize where the model’s outputs appear in the prompt, generate multiple scores using varied positions, and then average these scores.</li> <li><strong>Few-shot demonstrations:</strong> Include examples that reflect the natural score distribution to help the judge model calibrate its scoring mechanism.</li> <li><strong>Reference solutions for complex tasks:</strong> Incorporate correct solutions to challenging math or reasoning problems into the prompt, giving the judge a reference point when evaluating responses.</li></ul> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1s5tre3">While many existing studies have attempted the aforementioned bias-mitigating methods in pairwise comparisons, these strategies have not been fully explored in other setups. Moreover, pairwise comparison has its inherent limitations. First is the computational efficiency. If we have n different responses to compare, LLMs will take O(n^2) times to judge. Second, pairwise comparison is known to be affected by primacy or recency bias, as mentioned before. Third, it is hard to quantify the difference between the two responses. For example, it may be difficult for models to judge when the two responses are equally preferable based on human evaluations.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1xtvecb">To address these research gaps, our study aims to reduce judgement inconsistency in various usage contexts, using pointwise scoring from a scale of 1 to 10. Specifically, we asked the following research questions under the context of pointwise scoring:</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1k5droe"><li>Does higher temperature result in larger variances (experiment 1)?</li> <li>Do larger models get less affected by temperature (experiment 2)?</li> <li>Does Chain-of-Thought make the model more consistent? What about post-hoc reasoning (experiment 3)?</li> <li>Does giving the judge grading guidelines reduce the variance? Are more detailed guidelines better (experiment 4)?</li></ul> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1knl40e">The main motivation for our study is to evaluate and improve the consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge, providing scalable and interpretable approaches to estimate human preferences.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-3t9d54">How Consistent Are the Judges?</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1l65pdc">The first question we want to explore is how consistent the judges are in their grading. How to reduce the variances in numerical grading to make the judges more consistent?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-136eryf">Before we dive into specific experiments, I want to introduce the setup of experiments.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-iqmc2q">Experiment Setup</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-txko4c">Basically, we ask judge LLMs to grade responses of other LLMs to some question.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ij5ge5">The question and response pairs come from MT-bench, a dataset consisting of 3,300 expert-level pairwise evaluations conducted by humans, assessing responses from six different models to 80 MT-Bench questions [4]. Responses were sampled from models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-v1, Vicuna-13B, Alpaca-13B, and LLaMA-13B. The annotations were mainly performed by graduate students with specialized knowledge in the subject areas relevant to the questions. We downloaded the dataset from <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/mt-bench" rel="nofollow">Hugging Face</a>. We used MT-bench because we think it covers a wide range of cases representative of where LLM-as-judge is applied.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-d7h19k">The specific setup depended on individual experiments, but all setups have some commonalities. We always use a common opening prompt or some variations of it, as taken from the work by Zheng et al [4].</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1am3zs7">An example of a prompt would be:</p> <pre class="language-python"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-python">prompt <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token triple-quoted-string string">"""[System]

We didn’t use LLMs from other families because we don’t want to introduce confounding variables such as self-enhancement bias [1], meaning that the models tend to give biased preference toward responses generated from its own family, perhaps due to similar training data and architecture.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-a2260w">Third, the grade is always parsed using OpenAI’s structured output feature.

Experimental results support this hypothesis: lower temperatures indeed result in smaller variances.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-vq65ty">The following plot illustrates results obtained by evaluating three different judges (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across temperature settings ranging from 0 to 1 in 0.1 increments.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3duiz"><img src="/blogs/deep_learning/2.png" alt="Temperature vs Variance plot showing correlation between higher temperatures and increased variance" title="Temperature vs Variance plot showing correlation between higher temperatures and increased variance"></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-olkyyy">(Note: The variance is generally low, indicating that the judges are fairly consistent most of the time given the same prompt.

It seems that GPT-4o-mini is less affected by temperature compared to GPT-4o and GPT-3.5-turbo. This is confirmed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests: at higher temperatures (temperature = 0.6, 0.7, 0.8), there is strong evidence suggesting that GPT-4o-mini has less variance compared to GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o (<code>p &lt; 0.05</code>).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-12df75n">So, what has made GPT-4o-mini more consistent than other models?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ji1of7">It is certainly not model size that led to the difference, as in terms of size, GPT-4o-mini should be between GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o. If a smaller model resulted in less variance, GPT-3.5-turbo would have the smallest variance.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14g7fuf">We hypothesize that this difference is due to its training process, specifically distillation. Even though OpenAI has not made its training process public, we know that GPT-4o-mini was released on July 18, 2024, a month after the larger GPT-4o model, which debuted on May 13, 2024. It is reasonable to conjecture that GPT-4o-mini is a distilled version of GPT-4o. In the work by Safaryan et al. [5], the author argues that knowledge distillation reduces the variance of output because the student approximates the teacher model’s complex decision boundaries, resulting in smoother and more generalized boundaries. In other words, distillation serves as a regularizer, preventing the student model from overfitting to noise in the training data.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gbdbmk">Now we have an understanding of the model and temperature choice, let’s move on to the prompt-engineering techniques. <strong>From now on, if otherwise mentioned, the model would be GPT-4o-mini and the temperature would be 0.5.</strong></p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1ap7by4">Experiment 3: Does Giving the Judge Grading Guidelines Reduce the Variance? Are more detailed Guidelines Better?</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1sdumse">When asking many humans to grade something on a numerical scale, the usual consistency practice is to have a grading guideline of what a score of 1 means, what a score of 2 means, etc.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ulsg5f">For LLM judges, people also commonly include grading guidelines in the prompt, in hope of increasing grading consistency. We’d like to explore whether these grading guidelines can actually help LLMs grade more consistently. After all, LLMs are more known for their language understanding than math. Surely the word “mediocre” means more to them than the number “5”, right?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-wchwmb">To investigate whether a more detailed grading guideline leads to more consistent grading, we wrote, in the judge prompt, grading guidelines with different levels of specificity, ranging from the simplest to the most specific.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gbgop8">Here are the levels of specificity we investigated:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-1p3fp7u"><li><strong>(Baseline, no guideline)</strong> Please provide only a score, with no explanation.</li> <li><strong>(Basic guideline)</strong> Please provide only a score, with no explanation. 1 means terrible, 5 means mediocre, and 10 means perfect.</li> <li><strong>(full scale)</strong> Please provide only a score, with no explanation.

A possible explanation is that for humans the grading guideline is there to help with inter-rater reliability, meaning the consistency between different people.

Levene’s test confirms this (<code>p &lt; 0.05</code>). In other words, chain-of-thought does not make the model’s grading more consistent. In fact, it makes the variance bigger!</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-egbu46">How to explain this phenomenon?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-egchjt">We believe this is due the autoregressive nature of the LLM, where each reasoning step is conditioned on prior tokens. This dependency <a href="https://blog.iese.edu/artificial-intelligence-management/2024/chain-of-thought-reasoning-the-new-llm-breakthrough/" rel="nofollow">can magnify errors</a> [7] or deviations in earlier reasoning steps, contributing to higher variance. In other words, diverse reasoning paths lead to different conclusions. This should be able to be improved through the ”<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171" rel="nofollow">self-consistency</a>” [8] technique, but without it, CoT actually leads to higher variance in grading, which is potentially undesirable.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1h546mt">What is harder to explain is that prompting the LLM to add reasoning after the score also leads to less consistent grading. Theoretically, since the LLM is autoregressive, later tokens should not affect earlier tokens, but it appears that is not the case. While the difference in variance between reasoning after and no reasoning is not statistically significant (<code>p = 0.12</code>), it might still be worth discussing. We have no good theoretical explanation for this, so it might be an artifact of how OpenAI handles function calls, where even if “reasoning” appears later than “score” in the function argument, somehow the “score” token still attends to the “reasoning” tokens.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-wv2k8d">The “reasoning increases variance” phenomenon is also confirmed by the score distribution (we also included the version without reasoning below for convenience of comparison).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-62z9ob"><img src="/blogs/deep_learning/6.png" alt="Score distribution with and without reasoning" title="Score distribution with and without reasoning"> <img src="/blogs/deep_learning/7.png" alt="Score distribution with and without reasoning" title="Score distribution with and without reasoning"></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-g19qq4">It seems that GPT-4o-mini, our “star of consistency” in Experiment 1, is more affected by reasoning than GPT-3.5 or GPT-4o. Kruskal-Wallis H-test confirms that this difference exists at temperature = 1.0 (<code>p &lt; 0.01</code>), but less so at lower temperatures, such as 0.5 (<code>0.05 &lt; p &lt; 0.1</code>) or 0.3 (<code>p &gt; 0.1</code>). At temperature 1.0, GPT-4o-mini is significantly more affected by reasoning than GPT-4o and GPT-3.5-turbo, according to Mann-Whitney U tests (<code>p &lt; 0.01</code>).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1o5s1ea">We have three possible explanations for this:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-5p5t65"><li><strong>Confusion hypothesis</strong>: Less capable models (like GPT-4o-mini compared to GPT-4o) “confuse themselves” when reasoning, especially at higher temperatures, leading to more varied paths and conclusions. This wouldn’t explain why GPT-3.5-turbo is also less affected, though.</li> <li><strong>Distillation hypothesis</strong>: If, as hypothesized in Experiment 2, GPT-4o-mini has lower variance when it doesn’t reason because it is trained on a smoother decision boundary, the teacher model being an implicit regularizer protecting it from the noise in the data, the reasoning might be where the noise in the data rears its ugly head.</li> <li><strong>Capped variance hypothesis</strong>: Reasoning might only increase the variance to a certain level for a given temperature. For GPT-4o and GPT-3.5, they may have already reached that level of variance, so reasoning does not make it worse. But because GPT-4o-mini initially had a smaller variance, reasoning increased it more.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yr8ra7">This indicates that the chain-of-thought reasoning technique, without self-consistency, can result in undesirable outcomes such as inconsistency, and its effect on different models is disproportionate.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-m3wtbj">People generally believe chain-of-thought is good, but here we show that it hurts consistency. Is there another possibility here? Is it possible that chain-of-thought hurts consistency, but in some good way because it changes a consistently bad grading to a sometimes good grading? We will explore this in the following experiment.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1btsz2h">Experiment 5: How does Pointwise Grading compare to Pairwise Comparison? Does certain techniques improve its Agreement with Human Evaluation?</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-slvmid">We have shown some techniques that would improve or hurt consistency. However, the reason we use LLM judges is that they could approximate human preference, which is otherwise expensive to obtain. Does there exist a bias-variance tradeoff? Do these techniques that help with consistency also help with human alignment? Does chain-of-thought hurt consistency but improve grading by turning consistently bad grading into sometimes good grading?</p> <h4 data-svelte-h="svelte-1ilx9ho">Experiment Setup</h4> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-o9swd2">We conducted our experiments using a subset of the MT-bench dataset. This dataset contains 1,000 pairs of responses generated by two different models, along with expert annotations that indicate which response is better (“model_a,” “model_b,” or “tie”).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-92upv"><strong>Prompt Design</strong>: For our baseline, we used pairwise comparison, which is the standard method for judging two responses. We adopted the prompt from [2], attached below.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1c78m3h"><img src="/blogs/deep_learning/8.png" alt="Baseline prompt example for pairwise comparison" title="Baseline prompt example for pairwise comparison"></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-u72j06"><strong>Scoring</strong>:</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1w1ag1f"><li>If the human and the LLM both selected “model_a,” “model_b,” or “tie,” the LLM earned 1 point.</li> <li>If one selected “model_a” or “model_b” and the other selected “tie,” the LLM earned 0.5 points.</li> <li>Otherwise, the LLM earned 0 points.</li></ul> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1p2ykfa">The total accuracy was calculated as the proportion of points scored over all pairs.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dwxmxe"><strong>Converting Pointwise Grading to Pairwise Comparison:</strong></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ssrb0l">To evaluate pointwise grading, we used the following approach:
• Assign grades to each response independently on a numerical scale (e.g., 1 to 10).
• Compare the grades:
• If the grade for one response was higher, it was deemed the better response (e.g., “model_a” or “model_b”).
• If the grades were equal, the outcome was labeled “tie.”
• We applied this conversion across all 1,000 response pairs and evaluated variations of pointwise grading using the same scoring system as the baseline.</p> <h4 data-svelte-h="svelte-st3cmk">Results</h4> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-7tn7e4"><img src="/blogs/deep_learning/9.png" alt="Results comparing different methods" title="Results comparing different methods"></p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-1j07rn6"><li><strong>All methods outperformed random choice or always returning “tie.”</strong></li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-jn0wfd">This was expected, as both pairwise and pointwise methods leverage the LLM’s understanding of response quality.</p> <ol start="2" data-svelte-h="svelte-gv2oyq"><li><strong>Chain-of-thought reasoning performed significantly worse than other techniques.</strong></li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-16j9gch">This was confirmed using a Friedman test followed by a post-hoc Nemenyi test (<code>p &lt; 0.05</code>).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1v5j95c"><img src="/blogs/deep_learning/10.png" alt="Graph showing performance comparison of different methods" title="Graph showing performance comparison of different methods"></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-mnju58">As we can see from the graph, while the difference in terms of human alignment for other non-baseline methods are statistically insignificant, all non-baseline methods are better than “reasoning before”, i.e. chain-of-thought.</p> <h4 data-svelte-h="svelte-1ymxjsl">Temperature’s Effect on Alignment</h4> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13zz6j8">We further analyzed how temperature affects agreement with human evaluations. The results provided additional insights:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-wwqcpv"><img src="/blogs/deep_learning/11.png" alt="Temperature's effect on model performance" title="Temperature's effect on model performance"></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-4zjp48">It seems like the higher the temperature, the worse the reasoning gets. This is confirmed by a Friedman test (<code>p &lt; 0.001</code>). The difference for “no reasoning” is statistically insignificant (<code>p &gt; 0.1</code>).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1c58x56">A possible explanation is the <strong>Confusion Hypothesis</strong> from Experiment 2: when reasoning at higher temperatures, LLMs may generate overly complex or divergent paths, “confusing” themselves. In such cases, relying on the model’s initial intuition—captured in the first token—can produce better results.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-grw4hp">Conclusion</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bkf092">In conclusion, in using LLM as a judge, compared to pairwise comparison, pointwise grading is just as good, if not better, at matching human preference. It is scalable, less bias-prone, and allows specifying a confidence interval. It is fairly consistent already (variance <code>&lt; 0.4</code> in most cases), but if we want more consistency, we should grade at lower temperature like t=0.2 without chain-of-thought, using a distilled model like GPT-4o-mini. Increasing the number of trials and giving scoring guidelines doesn’t actually affect the output.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-nlf1j6">Bibliography</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1bbv1qs">[1] Wolfe, C.
