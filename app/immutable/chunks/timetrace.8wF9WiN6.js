Engineers get their kicks out of polishing a product and tweaking details; they’re all about making it work perfectly and look beautiful. Researchers, on the other hand, chase the intellectual thrill of solving interesting problems—they’re in it for the brain candy, not the fine-tuning. They’re fun to brainstorm with and great for bouncing ideas off, but if you need someone to cater to user needs, polish a product, or show up for weekly meetings, they’re probably not the ones for the job.",Lt,K,pi="In class group projects, it’s tough to see this distinction because engineers and researchers are usually both just trying to get an A. But in a real project, the difference is crystal clear. Especially early on, when there’s no visible outcome, what keeps a project alive is internal drive. Engineers and researchers have totally different drives, so if you want them on your team, you’ve got to manage your expectations and find different ways to motivate them.",Mt,V,fi="And of course, engineers vs. researchers is just one way to categorize people—there are so many dimensions.

If they’re forced to join one, they keep their cameras off, only speak when directly called on, and want it over ASAP so they can get back to coding and getting things done. Their favorite action item is “refactor the codebase,” which is like cleaning up a messy room. It means rewriting existing code in a more “elegant” way that doesn’t change any features but somehow makes them feel refreshed, ready to churn out new code.",Ot,ie,xi="Product people, on the other hand, need meetings. They have to tell the devs what to build and how, to make sure the code turns into something valuable for users. They love brainstorming thoughtful, unique features to release ASAP. The issue?
