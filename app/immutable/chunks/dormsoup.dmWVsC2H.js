So, we made a multi-stage pipeline where it first summarizes the event, then explains why it should or shouldn’t have each tag, and finally gives us the tags. We even had it do this three times and then picked the tags that showed up in all three runs, just to be sure. To save money, we used GPT-3.5 to check if an email actually had an event, and then let GPT-4 handle the details like time and location.",W,C,X="In the end, we were glad we went with LLMs. There was another group trying to use Regex to do the same thing, but their progress was much slower because emails, being so unstructured, defy traditional parsing.",q,T,$='<p><img src="/blogs/dormsoup/stats.png" alt="Number of users by time"/></p> <figcaption>At the time of writing (Aug 2024), we helped 959 users find the events they were looking for, the peak being the start of the school year.
