Dear Professor Sussman,

I encountered some doubts while reading Section 3.2
(Extensible Generic Procedures) over and over again to
figure out the interfaces. The goal of submitting psets,
as you said, is to talk about what I have learned and what
I want to learn more about. This essay does just that. I
call it "The Paradox of Elegance: Mud Huts and Diamond Palaces",
and I am eager to hear your thoughts.

"Diamond-like systems are beautiful, but it is very hard to
add to a diamond. If a system is built as a ball of mud, it
is easy to add more mud."

In class, you discussed the distinction between diamond-like
systems and ball-of-mud-like systems. A ball of mud is simple,
flexible, and easy to modify, while a diamond is intricate,
rigid, and hard to modify. You advocate for the ball-of-mud
approach, using "generic procedures" that could be modified
after creation by adding different handlers that can be
applied to different situations. You argue that, after we build
procedures, they can often be adapted to new situations.
A monolithic chess program can only do chess, but a general
board game program initially written for chess can be adapted
to checkers. Arithmetic could be generalized by redefining
"plus" procedures to enable addition between numbers and
symbols, allowing a program that used to give you numbers to
give you a formula instead. You argue that this is what
generality means - this is the ball-of-mud system you can
always add to. You can develop a codebase over a lifetime,
know it inside-out, and the most significant pleasure is the
domain-specific insight it gives you, like understanding kinds
of rules a board game might have, or how this variable affects
the differential equation describing this physical scenario.

However, I think in a broader context, your system actually
resembles a diamond-like system, brilliant inside but hard to
adapt. Let me explain. Programmers program for a different
reason nowadays. Programmers today program to achieve goals, and
those goals are often constantly changing because what is
cutting-edge today is often obsolete tomorrow. Jupyter notebook
is a manifestation of this philosophy, where maintenance is
secondary to rapidly prototyping and testing ideas. Instead of
perfecting a code base, developers often abandon notebooks that
no longer serve their purpose. In this way, the focus is on
building up temporary "mud huts" that can be quickly discarded
in favor of new, more promising approaches. They shape their mud
huts however they like, and when the mud hardens, they just shrug
and find a new spot to start on a new hut that tests a different
architectural idea. In contrast, your philosophy of developing
a code base over a lifetime seems less adaptable, because while
you can easily switch from chess to checkers, they can easily
abandon chess and move on to Alpha Go, because their mud huts
are crappy so there is not much wasted effort. This idea of
minimum viable product and planned obsolescence is a uniquely
modern invention, where things are created not to last but to be
replaced, to be iterated on.

To contrast with mud huts, I would like to propose the metaphor
of a diamond palace with high walls to illustrate the limitations
of your approach. Once you have lived in a diamond palace for a
while (read SDF and figure out the codebase), you can very
comfortably do things you are familiar with. You know all the
secret shortcuts from this garden to that garden (how to change
a chess system to a checkers system), and, being the master
artisan that you are, can even extend the balcony of your palace
to see something further (extend your code base to do, say,
matrix calculation). However, the comfort of a familiar lifestyle
makes you forget there is a vast world beyond your palace and
its walls, a vast world where the mud hut people measure with
their feet. While it may have been easier for them to take the
time to building a palace and settle down, they stay nomads,
learning how to live in jungles, deserts, savannahs, etc. many
distinct things you can do with programming languages such as
machine learning, web development, system security) while you
grow more and more comfortable within your room (Scheme). When
you want food you don't go out and hunt deer (build entirely
new systems in new fields not possible to create by just extending
the system), but you have your chef make you a cake (extend the
existing system). Life inside a wall is easy, but if you get too
comfortable living inside the walls, they become limiting, and you
miss out on what is beyond the horizon from your balcony.

When you have a hammer, you see everything as nails; When you have
a code base, the only things you can think of doing are things you
can extend your code base to do. Programming language is not only
the vehicle of our thought but also the driver - in this case a
particularly conservative one that only drivers at 15 mph on roads
that it knows well. The system started as a ball of mud, but as you
continue to rub that ball of mud, it becomes shinier and shinier
and it takes on this regular shape; it becomes so intricate that
people have to read a book and take a class to understand how to
add to it. It becomes the jewel on the crown in the throne room of
your mental palace, and you stop looking outside the walls - what
is there to look at anyway? All you need to look at is in this
room, right?

---- Afterwords ----
I hope you don't see this essay as a personal attack on your
philosophy because it is not. I find your philosophies on
programming, general science, and life immensely interesting,
but I couldn't help but have doubt about its relevance in today's
fast-paced world. These are *inner* doubts:  Everyone is moving so
fast nowadays, hopping from project to project, company to
company, and that can seem like the right way to do it, because
when you are starting you need to absorb wildly different ideas
like a sponge, right?

Only while trying to compose my ideas for this essay I realized
how well your philosophy worked out for you. You programmed for 40
years and developed a system that helped you solve anything you
are interested in. You could be content with taking a stroll in
the garden of your mental palace because you know this is all you
want. I can't do that. As a teenager, I have to go on adventures
and find out what I am interested in. So my task is not to extend,
but to establish.

Regardless, the metaphor of diamond and ball-of-mud is one I will
keep revisiting. The goal of contrasting two approaches is not to
start a holy war, but to reconcile, to find something in-between
that will work for me. On that note, please don't hesitate to
point out what I understood wrong to help me see better.
